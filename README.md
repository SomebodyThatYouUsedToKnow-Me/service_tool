A **web-based service checklist application** for field engineers to efficiently inspect machines, perform consistent checks across varying machine setups, and generate professional PDF service reports.

Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, the entire system is **configuration-driven via JSON**, so no code changes are required when machines, checks, or templates change.

---

## 🎯 Why This Tool Exists

Field service engineers often face the same problem:

- The **same checks** must be performed  
- On **many different machines**  
- With **slightly different configurations**  
- While still producing **clear, professional service reports**

This tool was built to:
- Eliminate repetitive paperwork  
- Standardize inspections  
- Reduce mistakes caused by forgotten checks  
- Allow fast configuration **without touching code**  
- Produce customer-ready documentation directly from the field  

It is especially suited for **tablet use on-site**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SomebodyThatYouUsedToKnow-Me/service_tool
cd machine-service-checklist

pip install streamlit reportlab

streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **🔧 Checks**  
  Individual inspection items (numeric or boolean).

- **📦 Templates**  
  Reusable collections of checks (e.g. conveyor, drive unit, safety).

- **🏭 Machines**  
  Machines combine one or more templates and may optionally override limits.

This structure keeps the system flexible, scalable, and clean.

## 📝 Features

### ✅ Check Builder

- ➕ Add and ➖ remove:
  - **🔢 Numeric checks** (with configurable min/max limits)
  - **✔️ Boolean checks** (OK / Not OK)
- 💾 Stored automatically in `checklist.json`

---

### 📐 Template Builder

- 🧱 Create reusable templates
- 🔗 Assign multiple checks per template
- 🧩 Combine multiple templates on a single machine
- 🛡️ Safe behavior when **no templates exist**

---

### 🏗️ Machine Builder

- ➕ Add, ✏️ edit, or 🗑️ delete machines
- 🧩 Assign multiple templates per machine
- ⚙️ Optional machine-specific numeric overrides
- 📱 Collapse / expand machines for a clean tablet UI

---

### 📋 Checklist Execution
